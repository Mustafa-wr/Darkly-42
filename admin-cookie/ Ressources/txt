When we open the website's homepage in BurpSuite, we see an admin cookie in the response that looks like "68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327." After decoding it using MD5, it translates to "false." Next, we encode "true" with MD5 to get "b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09." By turning on BurpSuite's intercept feature and replacing the cookie with the correct value, we click "forward" and successfully got the flag.
