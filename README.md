# Darkly: 42 Cybersecurity Project

## 🛡️ Introduction

Darkly is a web security project from the 42 Network curriculum. It focuses on exploring vulnerabilities in web applications and learning how to exploit them responsibly. The goal is to improve understanding of web security and develop secure coding practices.

## 📝 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a web application.
- **Skills Learned**:
  - Recognizing common web vulnerabilities.
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities ethically.
  - Implementing secure coding practices to mitigate risks.
- **Key Topics**:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Directory Traversal
  - Authentication Bypasses
## 🎯 Objectives

- **Analyze vulnerabilities**: Learn how they arise and their impact.  
- **Exploit responsibly**: Prove vulnerabilities without causing harm.  
- **Secure coding**: Propose fixes for identified vulnerabilities.  

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques

- **Tools**:  
  - [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)  
  - [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)  
  - [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)  
  - Command-line tools (curl, wget, etc.)  

- **Techniques**:  
  - Code inspection  
  - Input sanitization testing  
  - Manual HTTP request crafting  

## 🏔️ Challenges Faced

- Understanding how exploits work under the hood.  
- Balancing between automating scans and manual vulnerability discovery.  
- Learning the ethical implications of cybersecurity.  

## 📚 Key Lessons

- The importance of input validation and sanitization.  
- How small coding mistakes can lead to critical vulnerabilities.  
- Ethical responsibility when discovering vulnerabilities.
